## Root config: `cfg-fpv-tools`

`cfg-fpv-tools` declares the FPV tools available to all suites in this project:

```yaml
cfg-fpv-tools:
  - name: "sby"
    tool: "sby"          # binary on PATH, or absolute path
    opts:
      timeout: 600       # seconds per task; optional
      extra-args: ""     # appended to sby invocation; optional
      solver-versions:   # optional pins for reproducible CI; map
        yices: "2.6.4"   # solver name -> exact version string
        z3: "4.13.0"
```

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `name` | Referenced by `tool:` in `fpv.yaml` |
| `tool` | Binary name (PATH-resolved) or absolute path |
| `opts.timeout` | Per-task timeout in seconds, written to the sby `[options]` block |
| `opts.extra-args` | Passed through verbatim to the sby command line |
| `opts.solver-versions` | Optional map of solver name → exact version. Probed before every run; hard-fails on mismatch. Known solvers: `yices`, `z3`, `boolector`, `bitwuzla`, `btormc`, `abc` |

### Solver version pinning

`sby` happily picks whatever solver binary it finds on PATH. On CI, different runners can resolve to different versions and silently change proof outcomes — a proof that passes at depth 32 on one machine can time out on another. Set `opts.solver-versions` to lock the resolution: before each run, each pinned solver is probed (`yices-smt2 --version` etc.) and the run hard-fails with a one-shot summary of every mismatch if any pin doesn't match exactly. Resolved versions are logged as `fpv.solver_pins_resolved` so the run artefacts capture exactly what was used.
