## Harden a block

A block that a larger design instances as a hard macro needs three views of its routed result: an abstract LEF, a Liberty timing model and its layout. Set `harden: true` on the block's run to publish them to `artefacts/<run>/abstract/` as `<top>.lef`, `<top>.lib`, `<top>.gds` and `abstract.manifest.json`:

```yaml
runs:
  - name: alu_block_pnr
    # ...
    platform: sky130hd_tt_block
    harden: true
```

- `harden` implies `--gds` and forces `gds-mode: strict`, so it needs KLayout.
- The views are published together or not at all. If one cannot be produced, the run fails with `fail_stage: abstract` and leaves no `abstract/`; the routed DEF and ODB stay. Each rerun removes the previous abstract first.
- An abstract carries one corner's timing model, so `harden` on a multi-corner platform is refused before OpenROAD starts.
- The model has timing arcs only, so a parent's `rb power` sees the block as drawing 0 W. Run `rb power` on the block itself.
