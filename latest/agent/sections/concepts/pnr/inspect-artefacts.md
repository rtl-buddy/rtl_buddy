## Inspect artefacts

Outputs land under `<pnr-dir>/artefacts/<run>/`.

| File | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `pnr.log`, `pnr.tcl` | OpenROAD output and generated flow |
| `<top>.def` | Routed DEF |
| `<top>.routed.v` | Post-route gate-level netlist |
| `<top>.routed.sdc` | Post-route constraints |
| `<top>.routed.odb` | OpenROAD database used by post-P&R power |
| `timing.rpt` | Expanded worst-path timing |
| `route.drc.rpt`, `route.maze.log` | DRC summary and detailed-route log |
| `<top>.gds`, `<top>.png` | Optional KLayout outputs |
| `klayout.*.log` | Optional conversion logs |

On failure, inspect `pnr.log`. If KLayout alone failed, inspect the corresponding `klayout.*.log` and rerun with `--gds` or `--png` after correcting the installation.
