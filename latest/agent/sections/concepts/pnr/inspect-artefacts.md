## Inspect artefacts

Outputs land under `<pnr-dir>/artefacts/<run>/`.

| File | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `pnr.log`, `pnr.tcl` | OpenROAD output and generated flow |
| `<top>.def` | Routed DEF |
| `<top>.routed.v` | Post-route gate-level netlist |
| `<top>.routed.sdc` | Post-route constraints |
| `<top>.routed.odb` | OpenROAD database used by post-P&R power |
| `timing.rpt` | Expanded worst-path timing |
| `route.drc.rpt`, `route.maze.log` | DRC summary and detailed-route log |
| `<top>.gds`, `<top>.png` | Optional KLayout outputs |
| `klayout.*.log` | Optional conversion logs |

Every file above except the logs is deleted before each run — including the optional KLayout outputs, which are cleared up front rather than at the streamout step, so a run that dies inside OpenROAD or on a host without KLayout leaves no older layout behind. A run that dies short of routing therefore leaves the outputs it never wrote absent rather than the previous run's. Unlike the other flows, this happens even when OpenROAD itself is missing — the clear is the first thing a run does — because `rb power` resolves `<top>.routed.odb` by path and must never be handed the previous run's database. For the same reason a run that reaches `write_db` and then dies — killed, exiting non-zero, or logging an `[ERROR ...]` line — has its outputs removed again, so a `FAIL` never leaves a routed database behind. The optional KLayout steps behave the same: a zero-length GDS or a half-rendered PNG is removed rather than left to be read as this run's layout. On failure, inspect `pnr.log`. If KLayout alone failed, inspect the corresponding `klayout.*.log` and rerun with `--gds` or `--png` after correcting the installation.
