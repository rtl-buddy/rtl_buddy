## Inspect artefacts

Outputs land under `<power-dir>/artefacts/<run>/`:

| File | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `power.tcl` | Generated OpenROAD script |
| `power.log` | OpenROAD output |
| `power.rpt` | Raw `report_power` report |

On failure, inspect `power.log` for tool and input errors, then `power.rpt` for missing or malformed totals.
