## Set per-test resources

Reservations resolve field by field in this order: test, testbench, `cfg-dispatch.resources`, built-in defaults.

```yaml
testbenches:
  - name: axi_tb
    resources: {cpus: 2, mem: 8G, time: "00:30:00"}

tests:
  - name: axi_smoke
  - name: axi_soak
    resources: {mem: 24G, time: "04:00:00"}
```

Tests with identical resolved reservations share an array. Compilation normally uses `cfg-dispatch.compile`; when compilation occurs inside a simulation job, that job receives the field-wise maximum of both reservations.
