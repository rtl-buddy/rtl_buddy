## VCS hierarchical seed file

When using VCS with hierarchical instance seeding (`-xlrm hier_inst_seed`), VCS writes a `HierInstanceSeed.txt` file in the simulation directory after the run. `rtl_buddy` looks for this file to record the seed for reproducibility.

If the file is missing, a `sim.hier_seed_missing` warning is emitted in the log and the seed is not recorded, but the test result is not affected.

Ensure your VCS compile-time flags include `-xlrm hier_inst_seed` and that the simulation directory is writable so VCS can write the file.
