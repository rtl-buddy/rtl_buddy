## Tune the process-dependent steps

Placement, clock-tree and power-grid steps default to values calibrated for Nangate45. Another process declares its own. Every key below is optional.

```yaml
cfg-pdks:
  - name: sky130hd
    # ...
    placement:
      density: 0.55        # default 0.7
      padding: 2           # default 1, in sites
      macro-halo: 30.0     # default 20.0, in microns
    dont-use-cells: ["sky130_fd_sc_hd__probe*"]
    pdn-config: pdk/sky130hd/pdn.tcl
    rcx-rules: pdk/sky130hd/rcx_patterns.rules

cfg-pnr-platforms:
  - name: sky130hd_tt
    pdk: sky130hd
    cts-buffer: [sky130_fd_sc_hd__clkbuf_4, sky130_fd_sc_hd__clkbuf_8]
    placement:
      density: 0.6         # this platform only; padding stays the PDK's 2
```

- **`placement.density`** is the global-placement target utilization, above 0 and at most 1. **`placement.padding`** is cell padding in sites. A platform overrides either one field by field.
- **`placement.macro-halo`** (default 20.0 µm) is the channel kept between macros and between a macro and each core edge. Below about 19 µm on sky130hd, `pdngen` fails with `PDN-0179`. Raise it for a coarser grid; lower it only when macros do not fit.
- **`placement.macro-cell-halo`** (default 1.0 µm) keeps standard cells off macros with a hard blockage. Without it, the router can report a Metal Spacing violation at a pin on a hardened block's edge. `0` disables it.
- **`cts-buffer`** takes a name or a list. With a list, the first entry is the root buffer.
- **`pdn-config`** is a path, resolved from `root_config.yaml`, to a Tcl snippet that declares the power grid (`add_global_connection`, `set_voltage_domain`, `define_pdn_grid`, `add_pdn_stripe`, `add_pdn_connect`). The flow sources it after macro placement and calls `pdngen` itself, so the snippet must not. Unset means no power grid.
- **`dont-use-cells`** and **`rcx-rules`** are described below.
