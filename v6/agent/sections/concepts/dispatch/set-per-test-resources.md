## Set per-test resources

Reservations resolve field by field in this order: test, testbench, `cfg-dispatch.resources`, built-in defaults.

```yaml
testbenches:
  - name: axi_tb
    resources: {cpus: 2, mem: 8G, time: "00:30:00"}

tests:
  - name: axi_smoke
  - name: axi_soak
    resources: {mem: 24G, time: "04:00:00"}
```

Tests with identical resolved reservations share an array. Compilation normally uses `cfg-dispatch.compile`; when compilation occurs inside a simulation job, that job receives the field-wise maximum of both reservations.

Size `compile.time` for all unique compile keys in the suite because the build job processes them serially. Size `compile.mem` from elaboration, not simulation. Large generated structures can make elaboration the memory peak; Slurm reports `OUT_OF_MEMORY`, while local runs may show `Killed`, SIGKILL, or exit 137. Raise the field named by `reservation_advice[*].edit_hint`, not `sim_timeout`.

VCS license wait under `-licqueue` counts against the Slurm time limit. Give `compile.time` queue headroom; `compile.license_queued` records only completed builds that waited.

Dispatch requests `--acctg-freq=task=1` unless `sbatch-args` already supplies it. Keep fine-grained accounting if you want useful memory advice for short jobs.
